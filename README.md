# Saudi Founding Day Object Detection
---------------

This project aims to develop and train a custom object detection model on novel dataset to identify and recognize outfits that represent the Saudi Founding Day. 

In this project, I have trained the Saudi Founding Day outfits detector on Google Colab utilizing its free GPU resources using Tensorflow object detection API version 2.

## Technology and tools used:

Google Colab
Python 3.8.10
TensorFlow 2.11.0
Tensorflow 2 object detection API
labelImg

# Project steps/pipline:

* ## 1- Building the dataset (Data preparation)

I collected 500 images that express the outfits for the Saudi Foundation Day, then divided them into 400 images to be fed into the model in the training phase and 100 photos for the testing phase.
 

* ## 2- Annotating the dataset 

To annotate the dataset, I used the LabelImg tool on the train and test images, and labeled each image.
(It took me 3 hours and 30 minutes to finish the annotations process)
